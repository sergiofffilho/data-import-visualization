# Data Import and Visualization

This project is divided in three steps:

1. Read and manipulate data file - Using the [Panda](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to read the CSV file and convert it to a DataFrame object.
2. Create and populate a SQLite database - The database is consumed by the DataFrame created from the CSV file.
3. Visualization data in charts - The solution queries the data from the database created before and plot some charts using the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
